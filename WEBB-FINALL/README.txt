So this is an attempt to use JQueryTerminal library.

details at:
http://terminal.jcubic.pl/

OPEN FILE:
multiply-interpreters-demo.html
inside the folder examples
inside the folder jquery.terminal-master

and that will be the first draft sketch I have.

Unsolved problems:
A> After entered sub-directry I haven't found out a way to get out.

B> After selecting a genre from typing, haven't figured out how to show works down in the lower part of the site.
